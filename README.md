This repo contains the first JavaScript application I ever made!


The Psychic-Game works like this: [Try Me!](https://devonmartens.github.io/Psychic-Game/)

The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly) and Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses). The user only gets a certain number of guesses represented byGuesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update) and Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

After the end of these guesses the player can either win by guessing the letter, resulting in increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page). When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
